            We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the
            purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention

          <h2>User Rights and Choices</h2>
          <h3>Access to Your Information</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold
            about you. This allows you to receive a copy of the personal
            information we have about you and to check that we are lawfully
            processing it.
          </p>
          <h3>Correction of Your Information</h3>
          <p>
            If you believe that any information we have on you is incorrect or
            incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or
            complete this information.
          </p>
          <h3>Deletion of Your Information</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we delete or remove your personal
            data when there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
            This is not an absolute right; however, and there may be legal or
            other official reasons why the data needs to be retained.
          </p>
          <h3>Object to Processing</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data
            where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
            party) and there is something about your particular situation that
            makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
          </p>
          <h3>Restriction of Processing</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your
            personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing
            of personal information about you, for example, if you want us to
            establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
          </p>
          <h3>Data Portability</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request the transfer of your personal data to
            another party under certain conditions.
          </p>
          <h3>Withdraw Consent</h3>
          <p>
            Where you have provided your consent to the collection, processing,
            and transfer of your personal data for a specific purpose, you have
            the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at
            any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn
            your consent, we will no longer process your information for the
            purpose(s) you originally agreed to, unless we have another
            legitimate basis for doing so in law.
          </p>
          <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
          <p>
            To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the
            information provided in the &apos;Contact Us&apos; li of this
            policy. We may need specific information from you to help us confirm
            your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to
            exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate
            security measure to ensure that personal information is not
            disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

          <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            At BookOkay.app, we store and process all personal data within
            Germany. As such, we do not engage in international transfers of
            your personal data across national borders. This practice ensures
            that your personal information remains protected under the stringent
            data protection regulations enforced within Germany and the European
            Union.

            Should the need arise to transfer personal data outside of these

            appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses
            approved by the European Commission or other legally recognized
            mechanisms, to ensure the security and legality of the data
